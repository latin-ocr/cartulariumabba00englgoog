It will have, no doubt, been observed that three
successive years are named as the years of the founda-
tion of Rievaulx Abbey, 1131, 1132, and 1133. The
latter is the date quoted in the genealogy of Ros, which
is found on the fourth parchment leaf in tho Cottonian
cartularium (the substance of which is printed belowin
the Appendix), where the statement stands—“ Walterus
Espoeke, miles strenuus Conquestoris‚ tria fundavit
monasteria, Ι. de Kirkham, ΑΔ). 1122 ; ΙΙ. de Rievall,
1133; ΙΙΙ. de Wardon, 1136.’' As regards the other
two years named, the following extract from the
Hexham Book (S. S„ p. 108) will serve as well as any
other that can be adduced to bring the matter fairly
before uer—‘¹ Anno Mcxxxii„ Walterus Espec, vir magnus
et potens in conspectu regis et totius regni, monachos

Certainly it is stated thet the

the King died in 1135, md in 1145
Stephen was king. But while it is

⁸110 be remembered that by taking
it in the other seme we ignore the
direct statement in the uss. quoted
to the effect that Bildeedale was
given in 1145, and not before. These

difficulties must be balanced. So

while some of those named were

not know οἱ any who can be identi-

end there is something not unattrac-
