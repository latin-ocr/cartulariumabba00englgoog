how long there is nothing to show—he continued to be Prior
there. But inasmuch as Abbot william did not die until
August 1145, and Ailred or Etheldred was Abbot before De-
cember 114⁷, it is obvious that Waltheof's occupsnoy of the
abbatial cheir, if he ever did oocupy it, must have been of the
briefest character. For it seems hardly possible to throw over
entirely the statement of the Melrose Chronicler given above
as to tho feet that Maurice was Abbot for at least some short
time, in suecession to william. And, even so, we would have
to ignore the equally precise statement of the same authority
ss to tho immediate succession of Aelred to Maurice. But
whether wo admit οι· reject the allegation that Waltheof, late
l‘rior of Kirkhmn, was for a time, however short, Abbot of
ltievaulx, it is hardly possible to be blind to the possible illus-
tration homin found, of that remarkable phrase in the cym-
gmph between Kirkham and Rievaulx, on which comment has
boen made at a previous page (pp. xxvi, xxvii): “ Hoc quoque
sciendum est quod nec eloco nostro voluimus discedere, nec
Priorem nostrum amittere, donec ea quae inter nos constitute sunt
ud debitum finem producta fuerint,'' to say nothing of the final
clause of the smne document, which stipulstes that the seced—
ing Kirkhmu canons and brethren should have the same stend-
ing in the chapter und Order ot Cisteaux ss any monk of the
snid Ordcr. u· the approximate date assigned to this cyro-
graph bo correct (see above, pp. xxiv, xxv), it was too early by
four or tivo years nt least to think of lesing their Ptior in con-
sequence os his ‘⁴ secession ” to become Abbot of Rievaulx.
