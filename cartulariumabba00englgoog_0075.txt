or deductim, is one which involves circumstances and
considerations of no ordinary interest.

There are charters, or rather a sequence of charters,
which, per se, are in many respects almost unintelli-
gible. They speak of a dike (fossatum) o· dikes, of
apparently small but mysterious gra-nte in connection
therewith, of a quteria, of an insula, where no “insula ”
exists now, and where not one inquii-ing visitor in a
thousand would ever suspect, or, it may bc said, has ever
suspected, the being of an “insula‚” or island, in any
sense. And yet the fissam, the guteria, and the site
of the ‘¹ insula ”—an “insula '’ no longer—not only
exist, but, while explaining these otherwise mysterious
documents, hang themselves on to the history of the
contrastcd kinds of building-stone notieed a few sen-
tences above. One of these charters, from the identity
of the grantor no less than from the names of the wit-
nesses, would, under any circumstances, date itself
approximatcly about the middle of the twelfth century.
This is No. mcxv, But there is another which is more
spccific still, as being granted not only in the time of
King Stephen, but during the lifctime of william, the
first Abbot of Riovaulx, by the Abbot and Convent
of Byland, eoneeding to Ricvaulx the privilege of mak-
ing their fossatum below what was then called Mons
Esehebcrch and now Ashbcrry Hill, as well as the right
of ownership of the slip or slips of land which might
be enclosed between the fossatum and the river. The
chartcr in question is printed as No. CCXLIV. This
dates thc yzctere‘a as ante 1145. Other two, Nos. cco.
aud eccur. are fixcd as to date between 1193 and 1203,
