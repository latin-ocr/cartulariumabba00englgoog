the mid-stream line, as is the almost invariable rulo
in such cases, but deviates thei-esrom, and, so to say,
encroaches on the Byland side. These “encmach-

Abbcy in virtue of the concessione made by the By-
land community, confirmed by the Malbis uncle and
nephcw, in furthcrance of the monks' scheme of the
“ guteiia,'’ conduit or canal. And the unmistake-
able traces of the canal—indeed the very course
and bed of the canal itself, as well as these encroach-
mente—romain to explain the charters, as the charbem
are cndowed with a power to explain the deviatione
and the long deep canal-bed, in a way and with a
cleamess that could in no α priori way have been
soresccn.²
