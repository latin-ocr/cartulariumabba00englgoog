Dugdale and Burton, comprises thirty-one Abbots‚ who
are indicated in the subjoined list by the Roman
numerals in the second column. The numerals (Arabio)
in the first column indicate the number of the Abbots
who may be regarded as having actually presided over
the affairs of the Convent‚ and the suecession in which
they came. Three names in the list, it will be observed,
aro printed in italics. The first of these, Waltheof,
has no number of either kind prefixed to the name3 for
he does not appear in any of the aceredited lists, and I
am unable myself to see any reason whatever, even the
slightest, for admitting ΜΓ. Walbran's supposition that
ho was successively Abbot of Rievaulx and Melrose.
The other two, Roger and Bernanl, have the numerals
xv. and v. prefixed to their names, because they find
corresponding places in all the existing catalogues of the
Abbots of Rievnulx. But they have no numbers pre-
fixed in tho first column, because I am not only unablew
untisl'y mysclf thnt they ever actually reigned, but I
luwi- (ns l think) mitislied myself that no such Abbots
could have possibly existed at tho time alleged. It may
