this is a very important matter in itself, or that it has
any great siguificance in any way. The probability is
that, had we the means of exact information‚ this might
prove to be the normal condition in the foundation of
many, if not most, of our early Religious Houses. Ocr-

bearing of the earlier charters in the collection, with the
occasional and casual coincidences and suggestions met
with in a careful consideration and analysis of their con—
tents, all lead distinctly on to a general confirmation of
