only other commentary there seems to be any occasion
to offer on the matter is, that, however unexpected it
may seem, at first sight, that such a donation, accom-
panied by such a grant, should have been made to
Rievaulx at such a very early date in the period of ita
own existence, still a good deal of the aspect of strange-
ness will be removed by the reeollection that none of
these things were done in a corner. The pioneer colony
of Cistercian monks, “directed by St. Bernard,'' had
been in the country now for five or six years. The
mission would be known, the arrival heard of, wherever
there was not merely a zeal for the great and holy work
like nnto Espec’s‚ but wherever there was a latent
desire, a nascent disposition to engage in the same in
the hundrcds of places calling for an exertion of the
like missionary efforts. And then, I think, we may
allow a little for the motive involved in the more
medem phrase that it was “becoming the fashi0n” to
build monasteries. It seems simply impossible to doubt
that King Olaf must have heard of what St. Bernard
was doing sor North Englund in general, and at Walter
Espoc’s instance in particulam and then, what more
natural than that lie should apply for the aid he wanted
at what. would, to him, of necessity, appear to be the
