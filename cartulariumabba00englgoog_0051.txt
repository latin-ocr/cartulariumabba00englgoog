Oonstrained as I have felt myself by the eircum-
stances of the case to speak with the caution or reserve
qualifying the preceding paragraph, it is not without
diffidenee that I proceed to offer the following facts and
consideratione for a measure of attention. Ι have
noticed in a brief note on page 16 that throughout the
Museum us. Cartularium the Founder’s name is invari-
ably written Espec, and without the prefixed L; and
l might have added that the same rule prevails in all
the authentie early writings in which he is named. As
to precisely when the form L’Espec was introduced, or
why, I am not in a position to make any assertion ; but
my impression is that the earliest instance of what I
look upon as an innovation on the old mode of spelling
the name is certainly later by more than a century,
perhaps much more than a century, than the date of
the foundation of Rievaulx Abbey. The original form
is certainly Espec and not L'Espec. Now, here let me
draw attention to the circumstance that King Stephen
in 1135, in the presence of Walter Espec himself,
Geoffrey de Trailli, aud all Walter-’s other nephews
still living, confir-ms Espec’s foundation grant to
wardon Abbey in the following ternis :—⁸‘ Scitote me
